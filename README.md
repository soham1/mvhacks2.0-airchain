Let’s stop plane crashes.

Winner of MVHacks 2.0.

## What exactly does it do?

Ensures the integrity and validity of pilot certification and course progress by putting it on the blockchain. 

Aircraft Manufacturers add new feature to their model and save the data on the blockchain. FAA gets new feature from blockchain and notifies all flight schools about an updated training program. Flight schools prepare these training programs and register certified pilots on the blockchain. Airlines verify their pilots’ certifications via the blockchain.
